# Authentication and Profile Fix

This document describes the comprehensive fix applied to resolve authentication and profile issues in the Resource Pulse application when deployed to Render.com.

## Issues Addressed

1. Profile loading error with 500 response
2. "wt" token parsing error
3. userId type validation errors
4. Token refresh failures
5. Null userId in profile requests after token refresh

## Fix Components

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Enhanced Token Validation**:
   - Added explicit token format checks
   - Improved error handling for malformed tokens
   - Added specific detection for "wt" error cases

2. **Improved Token Refresh**:
   - Enhanced token refresh mechanism with direct axios calls
   - Added robust error handling and recovery
   - Implemented detailed logging for debugging

3. **Profile Page Enhancements**:
   - Added proactive token refresh before profile fetching
   - Improved error detection and recovery
   - Enhanced user feedback for authentication issues

### Backend Fixes

1. **UserId Type Enforcement**:
   - Modified token generation to ensure userId is a number
   - Added validation in authController.js for all userId uses
   - Enhanced SQL parameter binding with type checking

2. **Auth Middleware Improvements**:
   - Added userId validation in auth middleware
   - Improved token verification error handling
   - Added extended logging for debugging

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Added more detailed error messages
   - Improved logging throughout the authentication flow
   - Added validation checks at critical points

## Deployment Instructions

1. Apply frontend and backend fixes:

2 updates made to the codebase.

Creating documentation at /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/PROFILE_PAGE_FIX.md
Documentation created successfully.

Fix application complete!
The fix addresses the following issues:
1. Token parsing errors ("wt" error) in profile fetching
2. Enhanced error handling for malformed tokens
3. Added validation of token format before API requests
4. Improved cache prevention for authenticated requests
5. Added retry mechanism for profile fetching
6. Enhanced logging for debugging authentication issues
Frontend fixes applied

Step 3: Applying backend fixes...
- Updating authController.js to ensure userId is numeric
- Adding debug logging to token refresh mechanism
- Enhancing auth middleware to validate userId
Starting application of backend fixes...
Creating backup of /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/resource-pulse-backend/controllers/authController.js to /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/resource-pulse-backend/controllers/authController.js.bak
Creating backup of /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/resource-pulse-backend/middleware/auth.js to /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/resource-pulse-backend/middleware/auth.js.bak
Backups created successfully.
Applying fixes to auth controller...
Auth controller replaced with fixed version successfully.
Updating auth middleware...
Auth middleware already contains the fix.

Fix application complete!

The applied fixes address the following issues:
1. Force userId to be a number in JWT token payload
2. Add validation of userId in auth controller
3. Ensure userId is properly converted before SQL operations
4. Add better error handling and reporting

Next steps:
1. Restart the backend server
2. Test the profile API by logging in and viewing the profile page
3. Check server logs for any remaining errors
Backend fixes applied

Step 4: Setting up diagnostic tools...
Diagnostic tools ready

Step 5: Updating documentation...
Documentation created in AUTH_TOKEN_FIX.md

Rollback script created: rollback-auth-fix.sh

=========================================
Fix application complete!
=========================================

Next steps:
1. Deploy the backend to Render.com
2. Deploy the frontend to Render.com
3. Test the application by logging in and viewing your profile
4. If any issues persist, run the rollback script: ./rollback-auth-fix.sh

For additional debugging, use:
- node resource-pulse-backend/debug-token-refresh.js
- node resource-pulse-backend/enhanced-debug-auth.js

Documentation has been saved in AUTH_TOKEN_FIX.md
=========================================

2. Run the token refresh diagnostic:
   ======== TOKEN FLOW DEBUGGING ========
Starting debug of full authentication flow...

----- STEP 1: GET TEST USER -----
Connected to SQL Server
Found test user: {
  UserID: 1,
  Username: 'admin',
  Email: 'admin@resourcepulse.com',
  Role: 'admin',
  IsActive: true
}

----- STEP 2: LOGIN -----

3. Deploy to Render.com
   - Deploy backend first
   - Then deploy frontend

4. Verify fix by:
   - Logging in to the application
   - Navigating to the profile page
   - Testing token refresh by waiting > 20 minutes
   - Checking application logs for any errors

## Rollback Procedure

If issues persist:
1. Restore from backups in the .backups directory
2. Run the rollback script: `./rollback-auth-fix.sh`

## Additional Diagnostic Tools

1. `debug-token-refresh.js` - Tests the entire token refresh flow
2. `enhanced-debug-auth.js` - Diagnoses token and userId issues

## Contributors

Fix implemented by Claude AI Assistant based on detailed debugging and analysis.
