# Auth Profile Fetch Fix

This document explains the fix applied to resolve the issue with fetching user profile data in the ResourcePulse application.

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing problems with the user profile fetching functionality, where the frontend was unable to properly retrieve the user's profile data from the backend API despite having valid authentication tokens.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough debugging, the following issues were identified:

1. **Interceptor Conflicts**: The axios interceptors for handling authentication were not properly managed, leading to potential conflicts.

2. **Caching Issues**: The browser or network was potentially caching API responses, preventing fresh data from being retrieved.

3. **Token Refresh Logic**: The token refresh logic had edge cases where it might not refresh when needed, particularly for profile fetches.

4. **Error Handling**: The error handling in the profile fetch flow was not robust enough to properly recover from certain error conditions.

## Fix Details

The fix addresses these issues through several key improvements:

1. **Direct API Request Method**: Added a more robust profile fetching method that makes a direct axios request, bypassing potentially problematic interceptors.

2. **Enhanced Cache Prevention**: Added explicit cache control headers to prevent any caching of auth-related requests.

3. **Token Age Tracking**: Implemented tracking of token age to better determine when tokens should be refreshed, rather than relying solely on 401 errors.

4. **Improved Interceptor Management**: Enhanced the cleanup of existing interceptors to prevent duplication and conflicts.

5. **Better Error Recovery**: Added a specialized retry mechanism specifically for profile fetches that fail due to token issues.

6. **Detailed Logging**: Implemented comprehensive logging to make debugging of auth issues easier in the future.

## Testing

After applying the fix, test the authentication flow thoroughly:

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Navigate to the profile page to ensure data loads correctly
3. Leave the application idle for a while (20+ minutes) and then attempt to use it again
4. Test the automatic token refresh mechanism

## Rollback Procedure

If issues persist, you can roll back to the original implementation:

```bash
# Restore the backup file
cp /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/src/services/authService.js.bak /Users/cortez/Documents/Projects/resource-pulse/src/services/authService.js
```

## Additional Information

The issue was thoroughly debugged by creating several test scripts:

- `debug-profile-fetch.js` - Tests direct profile fetching
- `debug-profile-api.js` - Tests the API endpoint directly
- `debug-cors.js` - Tests for potential CORS issues
- `debug-token.js` - Validates JWT token structure and expiration

These scripts remain available for future debugging if needed.
