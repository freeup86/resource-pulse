# Profile Page Fix

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve the issue with profile fetching when deployed to Render.com.

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing a "wt" error when attempting to fetch the user profile on Render.com. This was caused by token parsing issues in the authentication flow.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Token Validation**:
   - Added token format validation before making API requests
   - Implemented specific handling for malformed tokens
   - Added detection for the "wt" error case

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added more detailed error logging
   - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
   - Implemented specific handling for different error types

3. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Added exponential backoff retry logic for profile fetching
   - Implemented proper cleanup on fatal auth errors

4. **API Service Enhancements**:
   - Added request interceptors to validate tokens before requests
   - Enhanced response error handling
   - Added cache prevention headers

5. **Profile Page Improvements**:
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Improved user feedback for authentication issues
   - Enhanced recovery from authentication failures

## Deployment Notes

This fix has been applied to the codebase and deployed to Render.com. If issues persist, you can:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Look for "Profile fetch:" and "API Error:" log entries 
3. Verify that token validation is working properly

## Verification

After deploying, verify the fix by:

1. Logging in to the application
2. Navigating to the profile page
3. Checking that profile data loads correctly
4. Testing token refresh by waiting 20+ minutes and reloading
