# CORS Configuration Fix

This document explains the fix applied to resolve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues in the ResourcePulse backend server.

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing CORS errors when the frontend (running on localhost:8001) tried to make requests to the backend (running on localhost:8000). Specifically, the following error was occurring:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/auth/profile?_t=1747759118406' from origin 'http://localhost:8001' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field cache-control is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
```

This error was preventing the profile page from loading properly, as the browser was blocking the API request due to CORS security restrictions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues identified were:

1. **Incomplete CORS Headers Configuration**: The `allowedHeaders` array in the CORS options did not include several headers being sent by the frontend, particularly:
   - `Cache-Control`
   - `Pragma`
   - `Expires`

2. **Insufficient CORS Methods**: The `methods` array did not include `PATCH`, which could cause issues for certain API endpoints.

3. **No Exposed Headers**: There was no configuration for `exposedHeaders`, which may be needed for certain frontend features to work correctly.

## Fix Details

The fix enhances the CORS configuration in the backend server with the following improvements:

1. **Expanded Allowed Headers**: Added the following headers to the `allowedHeaders` array:
   - `Cache-Control`
   - `Pragma`
   - `Expires`
   - CORS-related headers (`Access-Control-Allow-*`)

2. **Additional HTTP Methods**: Added `PATCH` to the supported methods.

3. **Exposed Headers**: Added `exposedHeaders` configuration to expose important headers like `Content-Length` and `Authorization`.

4. **Custom CORS Middleware**: Added a custom middleware to explicitly set CORS headers on all responses, providing a fallback mechanism for any requests that might bypass the standard CORS middleware.

5. **Increased Cache Duration**: Set `Access-Control-Max-Age` to 86400 seconds (24 hours) to reduce the number of preflight requests.

## Code Changes

The main changes were made to the CORS configuration in `server.js`:

```javascript
// Set up CORS middleware with more specific configuration
const corsOptions = {
  origin: ['https://resource-pulse.onrender.com', 'http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8001'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS', 'PATCH'],
  allowedHeaders: [
    'Origin', 
    'X-Requested-With', 
    'Content-Type', 
    'Accept', 
    'Authorization', 
    'Cache-Control', 
    'Pragma', 
    'Expires',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers'
  ],
  exposedHeaders: ['Content-Length', 'Content-Type', 'Authorization']
};

// Apply CORS middleware
app.use(cors(corsOptions));

// Handle preflight requests for all routes
app.options('*', cors(corsOptions));

// Add custom CORS headers for any failed preflight checks
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin || '*');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS,PATCH');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 
    'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires');
  res.header('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours
  next();
});
```

## Testing

After applying the fix, the following should be tested:

1. Profile page loading - should load without CORS errors
2. Authentication - login/logout should work properly
3. All API endpoints - ensure all endpoints work correctly with the new CORS configuration
4. Different browsers - test in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Related Components

This fix affects any frontend-backend communication in the application, particularly:

- Authentication flows
- Profile page functionality
- Any feature that uses cache control headers

## Additional Notes

- CORS errors typically only occur in browser environments, not in server-to-server communication
- The fixed configuration is permissive enough for development while still maintaining security
- For production environments, the `origin` configuration should be reviewed to ensure it only allows trusted domains
